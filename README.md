C-minus Compiler
===============
In this project, we created a one-pass compiler for the C-minus programming language. C-minus is a simplified version of the C programming language.

# Phases
This project was divided into 3 phases:

## Phase 1
In this phase, we developed the scanner for our compiler. The scanner takes care of tokenization of the program given to it. The documentation of this phase can be found [here](docs/PA1/ProgrammingAssignment1.pdf).
This documentation also contains the token types recognized by the C-minus language.

## Phase 2
In this phase, we made the parser for our compiler. By identifying the C-minus grammar, the compiler can generate the program's parse tree, and detect potential grammatical errors. The documentation of this phase can be found [here](docs/PA2/ProgrammingAssignment2.pdf).
This documentation contains the Context-Free grammar of C-minus.

## Phase 3
In this phase, we went on to make the intermediate code generator of our compiler. The development kicked off by first generating the augmented grammar of C-minus. The documentation of this phase can be found [here](docs/PA3/ProgrammingAssignment3.pdf).
This documentation also contains the three-address codes generated by the intermediate code generator.
